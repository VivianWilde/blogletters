Edalyn
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Combat boots</li>
<li>Prepared</li>
<li>She had a shimmer over her shoulder</li>
<li>Seems out of it, muttering and not noticing us until</li>
<li>Her ghost (on her shoulder) pointed at Margaret</li>
<li>Claims to be from Absalom, definitely lying</li>
<li>A shut-in, but people call her things, and also she knows a lot about elephants.</li>

Fourth Party

<ul>
<li>Wearing a ship-of-theseus&#39;d tattered cloak</li>
<li>Cloak doesn&#39;t hide her outfit - she&#39;s dressed for the occassion. Very fancy, royalty-coded</li>
<li>Why&#39;s she here? A doctor of some acclaim</li>
<li>Speciality: Alchemy. Diseases of the heart.</li>
<li>Margaret is the name she gave, but it&#39;s fake.</li>
<li>She invited us to visit the Mwangi Expanse and see elephants</li>
<li>She remembers her original name, wants it to stay secret</li>

Ship
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<ul>
<li>Sailed off the coast of Geb/Nex</li>
<li>Skimmer</li>
<li>Meant for 4-5 passengers, incredibly swift</li>
<li>Magical sail: Catches breezes that aren&#39;t there, skip across the water.</li>
<li>Helmsman: Wide-brimmed hat that obscures his face.</li>
<li>A day for the journey.</li>
<li>The helmsman seems to be looking at Margaret.</li>
<li>He cracks a whip as if he&#39;s driving a horse, that causes the wind</li>
<li>Mechanism: It&#39;s hard to decipher, but there&#39;s some combination of a) elemental magic and b) spirits.</li>
<li>Is the ship magical?</li>

Private convo
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lyn spoke to Margaret in private</li>
<li>Afterward, Lyn is just chilling with the elephant</li>
<li>Margaret looks shaken</li>

<li>There&#39;s definitely something on Lyn&#39;s shoulder</li>

Okenno Port
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<ul>
<li>The port is not part of Okenno proper</li>
<li>It&#39;s a private dock that&#39;s more official, product of a treaty between Katapesh and Okenno. So a stopping-point for diplomats who don&#39;t want to worry about pirates.</li>

Misfortune for gold
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Filled with malevolent energy</li>
<li>We buy and sell curses</li>
<li>Ghosts attached to people: They don&#39;t know much</li>
<li>I have her card.</li>
<li>Absalom branch</li>
<li>Geb branch still operating, they think</li>

Den of Magical Secrets
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-4">
<p>(Fennec did this, not me, so IC I don&#39;t know any of this)</p>
<ul>
<li>Run by some kind of construct</li>
<li>Someone recognises Fennec, says &#34;what date is it?&#34;</li>
<li>Then is unsurprised when Fennec doesn&#39;t recognise them.</li>
<li>Future? Blipping around?</li>
<li>Geisthall is the weird time-travelling android.</li>
<li>It said the shop owner won&#39;t be around for very long</li>
<li>Is he killing people?</li>
<li>&#34;What&#39;s that thing on your back?&#34; &#34;As much as I wish I could tell you, I can&#39;t.&#34;</li>
<li>It gave Fennec intradimensional crochet purposes.</li>
<li>Linked pockets, basically,</li>

Purses
</h5>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-5">
<ul>
<li>Item exists in both purses at the same time</li>
<li>If people extract it from both purses at the same time, tug of war ensues</li>
<li>So we can use this to communicate!</li>
<li>Don&#39;t look in the purse, because that&#39;ll go badly</li>
<li>You could fit 3-4 apples in it</li>

Private talk with Margaret
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>She studied at the best necromancy school</li>
<li>She&#39;s not lying, but she&#39;s hiding <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a lot</span> about her history with Geb</li>
<li>&#34;I can&#39;t eat right now&#34;</li>
<li>Margaret had a private conversation with Lyn, and Lyn came out looking a little woozy</li>

New ship
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Pirates spreading through the port</li>
<li>Helmsman of the ship - looks identical to our helmsman from before</li>
<li>The pirates are most likely Nexian.</li>
<li>The pirates recognised me, and tried to bounty-hunt me.</li>
<li>They seem to be looking for Margaret (they had a wanted poster that vaguely resembles her)</li>
<li>So hypothesis: Margaret is undead was working for the Geb war effort somehow?</li>

Afterwards: Margaret
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Lyn knew Margaret&#39;s original name.</li>
<li>So the thing on Lyn&#39;s shoulder knew Margaret&#39;s original name.</li>
<li>Something bad happened to her in Geb, she fled</li>
<li>30 years since she fled, or so.</li>
<li>My fleeing was about 25 years ago</li>
<li>She&#39;s about 400 years old</li>
<li>Half-elf</li>
<li>Fangs are pretty short.</li>
<li>Do you remember your name? Yes, she does</li>
