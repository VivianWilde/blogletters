<li>Edalyn goes to the ruins</li>
<li>Near the ruins, the ground is disturbed. Mounds of dirt. Something has been dug up and reburied.</li>
<li>Some kind of claw marks in the dirt. As if a dog dug a hole and buried something.</li>
<li>Strongest thing: The Edalyn mound. Insanely high level.</li>
<li>We find a dug-up grave on the other side of the house and tracks leading into the darkness</li>

<li>Rikolakus carry diseases, and can infect others.</li>
<li>So a Rikolakus encounter</li>
<li>Oh Petey is a witch and Balthazar is her familiar</li>

<li>Augury said it would be good to bring it with us</li>
<li>Genevieve kind of wants to smash it</li>

Finding Out a Truename
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>You need to learn your truename to become a Lich</li>
<li>To understand X&#39;s truename - it hinges on X being able to discover their own name</li>
<li>Inscribing your own truename strengthens you by connecting you to the magic of the world.</li>
<li>A word of power is deeper than the lettering. To speak it is to feel at the essence of reality and punch a hole through which to bring that word forth.</li>
<li>Inscribing your name on something is basically keeping that hole open</li>
<li>Some wizards inscribe it inside an arcane focus</li>
<li>Names as a bargaining chip: Devotees of gods will offer up their true name as a show of devotion, which can provide amounts of power, at the risk of a data leak.</li>
<li>Weilding a truename: Exert control, issue commands, cause them to cower in fear, even undo their existence (handcuffs, anyone?)</li>

<p>Hey &lt;Name&gt;,</p>
<p>
Sorry to keep doing this to you, but I got a bug in my brain about a potential research direction and it seems like it&#39;d be up your alley.
I&#39;m looking into ways to recover pieces of erased memories (OOC analogy: Ways to recover fragments of deleted info off a hard drive). My recent research was on mental hardening, i.e resisting mental damage, I&#39;m interested in going a step further and undoing it. Might be a fun research project (and a fun collaboration if you want, once I&#39;m back from sabbatical…)
I&#39;m thinking of basically picking a particular form of memory erasure, and putting together a proof-of-concept exploit that undoes it, even just partially.</p>
<p>
I figure the first step in that is identifying the means by which memories were erased, by examining the holes they left in the brain. Any tips on if this is possible and how you&#39;d do it.
The second probably involves inducing the brain to fill the holes in naturally - exposure to the right stimuli, etc. Are there any reliable or especially effective ways to do this? I remember I read once that smells are especially evocative of memories, but that might just be apocryphal</p>
<p>
This is probably hubris, but I&#39;d love to be able to undo damage caused by religious/divine intervention. If you know anything about how the hell (pardon the pun) we could even go about that.
In particular there&#39;s a sort of &#34;test case&#34; I found that I&#39;m kind of curious about, a religious artifact that rewrites/erases memories. I stumbled across it in a book &lt;cite the book I found in Okenno&gt;, and I&#39;ve been researching how it messes with minds.</p>
<p>
&lt;Send them details on the slate from my loredumps (i.e what you&#39;ve given me from my lore checks. I&#39;m very carefully not mentioning that I have it&gt;
Some other things I know about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn&#39;t have a <em>complete</em> effect on documents, just on memories</li>
<li>The maker of the wish remembers stuff, it&#39;s possible they can select a few people to remember stuff as well (or perhaps they just tell those people)</li>
<li>This is just a rumor so it could be false (and probably is) but it&#39;s been recently used several times by the same person, which shouldn&#39;t be possible normally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for putting up with this, I can&#39;t wait to hear what you think.</p>
<p>
PS: I&#39;m kind of away from any good libraries right now - if there are any books you recommend on this could you just send me copies? Send the bill as well, I promise I&#39;ll reimburse you</p>
<p>
Your fellow mad scientist,

<li>The statue is a blood avatar, weak to cold and electricity.</li>
<li>But electricity damage hastens/quickens it.</li>
<li>We learned that ripping blood out of something&#39;s head with weird magic causes its eyes to pop out.</li>
<li>So conjecture that this is what the column did to everyone in the city.</li>
<li>But how did the statue get here?</li>
<li>After we beat the blood avatar, the column starts shaking and we get weird vibes</li>
<li>Zyzyx recognises it: In 10 minutes, it&#39;ll begin a blood drain effect. Draw the blood out of the entire city, and rebuild the avatar with that.</li>
<li>The ghost-things on Edalyn don&#39;t have a brain</li>

<li>So 30yrs since Margaret ran off, and 20yrs since Kiordan&#39;s wife&#39;s dissapearance became public</li>
<li>One more thing: 50 years ago, an ancient relic was discovered and held in a vault deep within the town hall.</li>
<li>So the tablet was originally held here.</li>
<li>So 50 years ago: Tablet was locked away. 40 years ago: Geb showed up and started meddling</li>

<li>Why&#39;s she here? A doctor of some acclaim</li>
<li>Speciality: Alchemy. Diseases of the heart.</li>
<li>Margaret is the name she gave, but it&#39;s fake.</li>

Ship

<ul>
<li>Sailed off the coast of Geb/Nex</li>
<li>Skimmer</li>
<li>Meant for 4-5 passengers, incredibly swift</li>
<li>Magical sail: Catches breezes that aren&#39;t there, skip across the water.</li>
<li>Helmsman: Wide-brimmed hat that obscures his face.</li>
<li>A day for the journey.</li>
<li>The helmsman seems to be looking at Margaret.</li>
<li>He cracks a whip as if he&#39;s driving a horse, that causes the wind</li>
<li>Mechanism: It&#39;s hard to decipher, but there&#39;s some combination of a) elemental magic and b) spirits.</li>
<li>Is the ship magical?</li>

<li>The port is not part of Okenno proper</li>
<li>It&#39;s a private dock that&#39;s more official, product of a treaty between Katapesh and Okenno. So a stopping-point for diplomats who don&#39;t want to worry about pirates.</li>

<li>Then is unsurprised when Fennec doesn&#39;t recognise them.</li>
<li>Future? Blipping around?</li>
<li>Geisthall is the weird time-travelling android.</li>
<li>It said the shop owner won&#39;t be around for very long</li>
<li>Is he killing people?</li>
<li>&#34;What&#39;s that thing on your back?&#34; &#34;As much as I wish I could tell you, I can&#39;t.&#34;</li>

      <description>It seems I&amp;#39;ve been invited to Lord Kiordan&amp;#39;s Grand Masquerade, for mysterious and of course undisclosed reasons. I was briefly tempted to refuse, but this is hardly an opportunity one can pass up. And besides, it has been a long time since I last passed through Geb. Too long, perhaps.</description>
