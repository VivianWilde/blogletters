<li>Blood is not from the material plane</li>

<li>Geisthal leaves the dogs to us</li>
<li>The blood: Hound of Tindalos. Extradimensional being that goes after being who violate the laws of time</li>

Investigations
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Eyes exploded from the back of skull</li>
<li>Conjecture: Some kind of brain damage? From too much mindfuckery?</li>

<li>3 figures atop the roofs</li>

Statue/Column
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Base: Depiction of a bunch of people wailing and blood flowing across the surface of the statue, out of people&#39;s eyes/mouths/ears/noses</li>
<li>Higher: People catching the blood and handing it higher up</li>
<li>Very top: Statue of a woman, her arms outstretched, fangs beared.</li>
<li>Figure named Zura, don&#39;t recall much else. Probably a vampire goddess though</li>
<li>Smaller figure with arms outstretched: A figure who looks a lot like Margaret.</li>
<li>She&#39;s adorned to look very similar to Zura, perhaps an avatar or scion?</li>
<li>Demon lords tend to have incarnations through another being.</li>
</ul>

Statue Fight
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Blood flowing up the statue: It bubbles and shifts as we leave</li>
<li>The blood is fresh</li>
<li>An arm reaches out as if from behind the blood, pulls itself up and out.</li>
<li>A vaguely Zura-looking 9-foot blood-figure emerges, wearing a crown and long flowing dress</li>
<li>The statue is a blood avatar, weak to cold and electricity.</li>
<li>But electricity damage hastens/quickens it.</li>
<li>We learned that ripping blood out of something&#39;s head with weird magic causes its eyes to pop out.</li>
<li>So conjecture that this is what the column did to everyone in the city.</li>
<li>But how did the statue get here?</li>
<li>After we beat the blood avatar, the column starts shaking and we get weird vibes</li>
<li>Zyzyx recognises it: In 10 minutes, it&#39;ll begin a blood drain effect. Draw the blood out of the entire city, and rebuild the avatar with that.</li>
<li>The ghost-things on Edalyn don&#39;t have a brain</li>
<li>We escaped the blood drain effect, with help from Margaret and an elephant</li>
<li>Margaret knows the dark crystal (at least in part),</li>

Town Hall
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Found a crystal in the doorway, Lyn took it</li>
<li>Found some documents in a safe, and also Iggly stole some valuables</li>
<li>The crystal: Fennec knows what it is, but in-character I don&#39;t know that</li>
<li>Geisthal bought it from us, in return for unspecified favors for both the group and Fennec specifically</li>
<li>Crystal: Blood jewel, formed from the blood of thousands. Vampiric currency and power-food</li>
<li>He seems to be telling the truth that it can&#39;t help with reversing</li>
<li>Geisthal has extraplanar plans with it</li>

Document insights
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<ul>
<li>40 yrs ago, fell on hard times</li>
<li>Wasn&#39;t bringing in enough food, etc.</li>
<li>Suddenly, Geb emissary shows up (on behalf of Kiordan).</li>
<li>Bolsters economy, in exchange for a small tax with interest</li>
<li>Suddenly town is thriving, resources and business flow in from Dawnfall</li>
<li>And then, odd stuff happens</li>

Odd Stuff
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Cult sets up shop!</li>
<li>Town debated, let cult slide because Dawnfall money</li>
<li>Around 20 years ago:</li>
<li>Cult built the column</li>
<li>Kiordan and his wife had plans for official visit</li>
<li>No more logs after the Kiordan visit from 20yrs ago</li>
<li>Around this time, Kiordan&#39;s wife goes missing</li>
<li>Per Margaret&#39;s memories: 30 years since she fled, or so.</li>
<li>So 30yrs since Margaret ran off, and 20yrs since Kiordan&#39;s wife&#39;s dissapearance became public</li>
<li>One more thing: 50 years ago, an ancient relic was discovered and held in a vault deep within the town hall.</li>
<li>So the tablet was originally held here.</li>
<li>So 50 years ago: Tablet was locked away. 40 years ago: Geb showed up and started meddling</li>
<li>So Kiordan&#39;s plans of &#34;get the tablet, do murder, and then spotless mind it&#34; dates back to 40 years</li>
