Waking Up




Geisthal&#39;s Card



Metal
Silver grin drawn on it
We can talk to Geisthal through it
Geisthal confirmed they can move through time and space
TODO: Read Geisthall&#39;s mind and create a paradox with future knowledge
TODO: I have a card for the Curse Store. Can I telegram them or anything?
Geisthal is being pursued by evil adversaries, they should get back to us in a day about investigating and removing the curse
Is Geisthal being chased by werewolves or some kind of eldritch dog? We heard a howl





Vampirism



Everything hurts
We need alchemy tools to brew a blood substitute
From eating blood: Flight, turning into animals, hypnosis, climbing
Animal or non-lethally extracted blood sates hunger but brings no powers





Geisthal



Covered in blue blood
Blood is not from the material plane
He gave us an alchemy set in return for the book on artefacts
Geisthal leaves the dogs to us
The blood: Hound of Tindalos. Extradimensional being that goes after being who violate the laws of time
So don&#39;t go reading Geisthal&#39;s mind



Curse Insight



Someone abused the thing, got too many uses out of it, Spider cursed it in annoyance
It&#39;s polluted with evil magic, we need to remove that before she&#39;ll even consider removing the curse









Throldum



Lumber colony
Former trade metropolis
Massacre took place here, from the documents



Running about



Zy runs off into the forest
Margaret stays back to do science
Lots of plant life
No birds or bugs
Noises up ahead: A dying animal
Big wooden wall, sharp points on top, keep people and animals out
Two large elephants, one dying (the parent) and the other (child) pushing at it.





Vampire Country



A year ago, a massacre (Kiordan) happened here
Two days ago (masquerade day), vamps were roaming the area sucking elephant and other blood
Something was trying to escape from inside the wall, digging a hole through with their fingers, they died, no blood in their fingers





Scaling the wall



There are hundreds of people, pale grey, stacked against the wall.
Dead, heads pulled back, as if they were fleeing something
Eyes are missing
Around 100 people
Top of a tall statue with arms stretched outward
Building: Town Hall





Investigations



Eyes exploded from the back of skull
Conjecture: Some kind of brain damage? From too much mindfuckery?
The gate closed behind us
3 figures atop the roofs
They haven&#39;t noticed us.





Statue/Column



Base: Depiction of a bunch of people wailing and blood flowing across the surface of the statue, out of people&#39;s eyes/mouths/ears/noses
Higher: People catching the blood and handing it higher up
Very top: Statue of a woman, her arms outstretched, fangs beared.
Figure named Zura, don&#39;t recall much else. Probably a vampire goddess though
Smaller figure with arms outstretched: A figure who looks a lot like Margaret.
She&#39;s adorned to look very similar to Zura, perhaps an avatar or scion?
Demon lords tend to have incarnations through another being.



Statue Fight



Blood flowing up the statue: It bubbles and shifts as we leave
The blood is fresh
An arm reaches out as if from behind the blood, pulls itself up and out.
A vaguely Zura-looking 9-foot blood-figure emerges, wearing a crown and long flowing dress
The statue is a blood avatar, weak to cold and electricity.
But electricity damage hastens/quickens it.
We learned that ripping blood out of something&#39;s head with weird magic causes its eyes to pop out.
So conjecture that this is what the column did to everyone in the city.
But how did the statue get here?
After we beat the blood avatar, the column starts shaking and we get weird vibes
Zyzyx recognises it: In 10 minutes, it&#39;ll begin a blood drain effect. Draw the blood out of the entire city, and rebuild the avatar with that.
The ghost-things on Edalyn don&#39;t have a brain
We escaped the blood drain effect, with help from Margaret and an elephant
Margaret knows the dark crystal (at least in part),







Town Hall



Found a crystal in the doorway, Lyn took it
Found some documents in a safe, and also Iggly stole some valuables
The crystal: Fennec knows what it is, but in-character I don&#39;t know that
Geisthal bought it from us, in return for unspecified favors for both the group and Fennec specifically
Crystal: Blood jewel, formed from the blood of thousands. Vampiric currency and power-food
He seems to be telling the truth that it can&#39;t help with reversing
Geisthal has extraplanar plans with it







Document insights



40 yrs ago, fell on hard times
Wasn&#39;t bringing in enough food, etc.
Suddenly, Geb emissary shows up (on behalf of Kiordan).
Bolsters economy, in exchange for a small tax with interest
Suddenly town is thriving, resources and business flow in from Dawnfall
And then, odd stuff happens



Odd Stuff



Cult sets up shop!
Town debated, let cult slide because Dawnfall money
Around 20 years ago:
Cult built the column
Kiordan and his wife had plans for official visit
No more logs after the Kiordan visit from 20yrs ago
Around this time, Kiordan&#39;s wife goes missing
Per Margaret&#39;s memories: 30 years since she fled, or so.
So 30yrs since Margaret ran off, and 20yrs since Kiordan&#39;s wife&#39;s dissapearance became public
One more thing: 50 years ago, an ancient relic was discovered and held in a vault deep within the town hall.
So the tablet was originally held here.
So 50 years ago: Tablet was locked away. 40 years ago: Geb showed up and started meddling
So Kiordan&#39;s plans of &#34;get the tablet, do murder, and then spotless mind it&#34; dates back to 40 years







Fennec&#39;s Secret: Paper from an old blind man

Step 2: Speak true name

Statue/Column

<ul>
<li>Base: Depiction of a bunch of people wailing and blood flowing across the surface of the statue, out of people&#39;s eyes/mouths/ears/noses</li>
<li>Higher: People catching the blood and handing it higher up</li>
<li>Very top: Statue of a woman, her arms outstretched, fangs beared.</li>
<li>Figure named Zura, don&#39;t recall much else. Probably a vampire goddess though</li>
<li>Smaller figure with arms outstretched: A figure who looks a lot like Margaret.</li>
<li>She&#39;s adorned to look very similar to Zura, perhaps an avatar or scion?</li>
<li>Demon lords tend to have incarnations through another being.</li>

Statue Fight
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Blood flowing up the statue: It bubbles and shifts as we leave</li>
<li>The blood is fresh</li>
<li>An arm reaches out as if from behind the blood, pulls itself up and out.</li>
<li>A vaguely Zura-looking 9-foot blood-figure emerges, wearing a crown and long flowing dress</li>
<li>The statue is a blood avatar, weak to cold and electricity.</li>
<li>But electricity damage hastens/quickens it.</li>
<li>We learned that ripping blood out of something&#39;s head with weird magic causes its eyes to pop out.</li>
<li>So conjecture that this is what the column did to everyone in the city.</li>
<li>But how did the statue get here?</li>
<li>After we beat the blood avatar, the column starts shaking and we get weird vibes</li>
<li>Zyzyx recognises it: In 10 minutes, it&#39;ll begin a blood drain effect. Draw the blood out of the entire city, and rebuild the avatar with that.</li>
<li>The ghost-things on Edalyn don&#39;t have a brain</li>
<li>We escaped the blood drain effect, with help from Margaret and an elephant</li>
<li>Margaret knows the dark crystal (at least in part),</li>

<ul>
<li>Found a crystal in the doorway, Lyn took it</li>
<li>Found some documents in a safe, and also Iggly stole some valuables</li>
<li>The crystal: Fennec knows what it is, but in-character I don&#39;t know that</li>
<li>Geisthal bought it from us, in return for unspecified favors for both the group and Fennec specifically</li>
<li>Crystal: Blood jewel, formed from the blood of thousands. Vampiric currency and power-food</li>
<li>He seems to be telling the truth that it can&#39;t help with reversing</li>
<li>Geisthal has extraplanar plans with it</li>

Odd Stuff
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Cult sets up shop!</li>
<li>Town debated, let cult slide because Dawnfall money</li>
<li>Around 20 years ago:</li>
<li>Cult built the column</li>
<li>Kiordan and his wife had plans for official visit</li>
<li>No more logs after the Kiordan visit from 20yrs ago</li>
<li>Around this time, Kiordan&#39;s wife goes missing</li>
<li>Per Margaret&#39;s memories: 30 years since she fled, or so.</li>
<li>So 30yrs since Margaret ran off, and 20yrs since Kiordan&#39;s wife&#39;s dissapearance became public</li>
<li>One more thing: 50 years ago, an ancient relic was discovered and held in a vault deep within the town hall.</li>
<li>So the tablet was originally held here.</li>
<li>So 50 years ago: Tablet was locked away. 40 years ago: Geb showed up and started meddling</li>
<li>So Kiordan&#39;s plans of &#34;get the tablet, do murder, and then spotless mind it&#34; dates back to 40 years</li>
