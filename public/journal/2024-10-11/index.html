Alonzo (Church), my colleague
Conjecture: Most &#34;memory-erasure&#34; is just burying.
Turns out I&#39;m right.
Unburying memories: Depends on the source
Some deities can truly wipe memories
BUT! That&#39;s not what happened to Margaret!
Buried in her, or perhaps in an external source.
There&#39;s often a link between a subject and the source/storehouse of the memories
Conjecture: Does the clean slate store the original unaltered memories, or reference/fragments somehow?
Evaluation: This may be possible. But the clean slate also creates new memories and manipulates old ones rather than erasing them. So it might be maintaining the &#34;web of real and unreal&#34;, or storing old memories, or some combination thereof.
The clean slate combines fabrication with truth. So if it holds any info, it might be a mix of real and fabricated.
Implication: Margaret got memories erased in non-clean-slate ways, since erased rather than rewritten
Identifying storehouses: Difficult generally. Magical signature analysis.
Can I try to read the mind of the Slate?
This is pretty hard undo.
Seek out original owners - presumably spider-priests in the expanse, or in Absalom.
Slate is also a repository of memories of some kind.
Can I interface with the slate? A: Maybe
Finding memories without storehouse: Doable (I did it). Some memories slip through the cracks, they can be uncovered with a good link that sparks the memories. But stuff in the repository is locked in.
If you aren&#39;t a god: Deletion is an option (although that didn&#39;t happen with Margaret, we think), reconstruction (overwriting).
That&#39;s not what Margaret has, she lost her memories
&#34;Supposedly the clean slate retains all the originals&#34;
He&#39;s doing undead tissue research. Introduce him to Margaret?
