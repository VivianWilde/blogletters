<li>A word of power is deeper than the lettering. To speak it is to feel at the essence of reality and punch a hole through which to bring that word forth.</li>
<li>Inscribing your name on something is basically keeping that hole open</li>
<li>Some wizards inscribe it inside an arcane focus</li>
<li>Names as a bargaining chip: Devotees of gods will offer up their true name as a show of devotion, which can provide amounts of power, at the risk of a data leak.</li>

Actual Letter

<div id="outline-text-headline-22" class="outline-text-5">
<p>Hey &lt;Name&gt;,</p>
<p>
Sorry to keep doing this to you, but I got a bug in my brain about a potential research direction and it seems like it&#39;d be up your alley.
I&#39;m looking into ways to recover pieces of erased memories (OOC analogy: Ways to recover fragments of deleted info off a hard drive). My recent research was on mental hardening, i.e resisting mental damage, I&#39;m interested in going a step further and undoing it. Might be a fun research project (and a fun collaboration if you want, once I&#39;m back from sabbaticalâ€¦)
I&#39;m thinking of basically picking a particular form of memory erasure, and putting together a proof-of-concept exploit that undoes it, even just partially.</p>
<p>
I figure the first step in that is identifying the means by which memories were erased, by examining the holes they left in the brain. Any tips on if this is possible and how you&#39;d do it.
The second probably involves inducing the brain to fill the holes in naturally - exposure to the right stimuli, etc. Are there any reliable or especially effective ways to do this? I remember I read once that smells are especially evocative of memories, but that might just be apocryphal</p>
<p>
This is probably hubris, but I&#39;d love to be able to undo damage caused by religious/divine intervention. If you know anything about how the hell (pardon the pun) we could even go about that.
In particular there&#39;s a sort of &#34;test case&#34; I found that I&#39;m kind of curious about, a religious artifact that rewrites/erases memories. I stumbled across it in a book &lt;cite the book I found in Okenno&gt;, and I&#39;ve been researching how it messes with minds.</p>
<p>
&lt;Send them details on the slate from my loredumps (i.e what you&#39;ve given me from my lore checks. I&#39;m very carefully not mentioning that I have it&gt;
Some other things I know about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn&#39;t have a <em>complete</em> effect on documents, just on memories</li>
<li>The maker of the wish remembers stuff, it&#39;s possible they can select a few people to remember stuff as well (or perhaps they just tell those people)</li>
<li>This is just a rumor so it could be false (and probably is) but it&#39;s been recently used several times by the same person, which shouldn&#39;t be possible normally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for putting up with this, I can&#39;t wait to hear what you think.</p>
<p>
PS: I&#39;m kind of away from any good libraries right now - if there are any books you recommend on this could you just send me copies? Send the bill as well, I promise I&#39;ll reimburse you</p>
