Return



Margaret is better than the Witch at plague-curing
Mosquito Witch is happy with us
She draws Fennec&#39;s blood, carves it into runes in the air.
The runes let her divine Fennec&#39;s past (full name), and present (his wife is in danger)
Rune language is ancient pre-existing. Lets someone read the present, like reading bones
Petey can understand it (when augmented by Zuni)
The Mosquito Witch isn&#39;t a manuscript, just a magical &#34;encoding&#34; of images and events. So the witch is experiencing visions of past/present/future.
The runes aren&#39;t the primary information career.
The Mosquito Witch has ADHD



Grandmother Spider



Does have followers
Hidden sanctuaries
Especially in the Mwangi Expanse
The village with the blood avatar mostly had religious symbols devoted to Gazrah, god of nature/wind/waves.
One personal trinket - suggests worship of grandmother spider. So there were adherents there, who were presumably purged
So a blood avatar was installed there, and another was installed in Shimmerford. A plot.







Loredump



Margaret figured out a cure,
Had it redacted from her memory
She figured out a cure, a way to reject Zura&#39;s gift. The secret is stored in Margaret&#39;s &#34;second laboratory&#34;
As punishment, Kiordan chose her to become the avatar of Zura
She escaped before that was completed
All but two lost their memory of Margaret and of the cure
Then later, Margaret had her own memories erased, just before Kiordan sent out a search party for her. Presumably she escaped, had memories redacted (willingly or not).
Given the patterns being pointed out, it seems that the memory-erasures we&#39;re learning about all come from the same source.
So almost certainly all are the slate
We did the mind-dive thing.
One word: &#34;Lastwall&#34;.
The only other person who remembers Margaret is someone close to her - wife/qpp/???. They&#39;re still around. 
Margaret has a way to contact her, via a spirit ritual with Lyn&#39;s help. 



Lastwall



It blew up eleven years ago.
Destroyed by the Lich-king Tarbafon
Now he rules over the remains, calls it the Gravelands
Tarbafon&#39;s soulcage is guarded by the god of undeath on a separate plane
Initially Lastwall was built around his prison
Tarbafon (the whispering tyrant) duelled a living god 4000 years ago. So he doesn&#39;t give a shit about Kiordan.
Geb (the necromancer himself) has zero respect for Zura, thinks she&#39;s a wannabe god.





Drannith



&#34;Drannith is an opportunist&#34;
Our faith in her is not misplaced (at time of speaking), but be careful
She&#39;s more in this to spite Kiordan than to help us.
Think about her. And about Womble.







Nomble



Nomble is waiting when we return to the house
Genevieve gets into an argument about how the House knows geography
Nomble wants to know where we&#39;re going





Next Stop



Grace, a town in Ustalov
Just outside the gravelands





Actual Next Stop



Steyr, to save Fennec&#39;s wife





Steyr



Small city
Portraits and mosaics of heroes of (place) 
Outskirts are quiet, but commotion from deeper in.
Some kind of angry mob.
militaristic, worried about spies, so harsh on black markets
People have been going missing at night
Monsters in the old farmhouse.
Bodies of victims have been found, so not turning a mass army



Farmhouse



4 guards
Waiting for something
Sounds of someone in pain
dried blood stains
growling sound
Mouse got grabbed by a vampiric catfolk
