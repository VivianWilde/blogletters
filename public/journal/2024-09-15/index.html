Picking back up



We haven&#39;t met a true Rikolaus, but we did find footprints. Suggestive




Zura



Bad stuff that happens if we take the idol: Zura is a demon lord. But she&#39;s not able to levy curses on artifacts like Spider can.
If it&#39;s pissing off the witch, she will not like us carrying it.
Zuni: &#34;The boy is safe&#34;
We dehallowed the statue
Zuni climbed onto my shoulder!
Zuni&#39;s claws are ephemeral and shifting



Paper Doll



The writing is leaking some red and sticky substance
It&#39;s not blood.
It tastes a bit like blood. But too sweet and viscous. Like sap.





We&#39;re off to see the Wizard Witch



Petey followed Zuni into a swamp
As the mosquito and Petey descend towards the swamp, they blip and vanish
There&#39;s a teleport field or illusory wall up



Tunnel



Sounds like a battlefield in the distance
Opens into a large chamber
People lying on straw mats, unconscious
Medbay?
Perplexed-looking Petey.
Two adults, two children
Children look like Petey
A 9ft tall hunched figure has bright red eyes











Mosquito Witch



We have a bargain:
We fell the tower
She will return Petey, and help us against Zura.
She&#39;s like a mentor/grandparent to Petey





Cultist&#39;s House Again



Tracks: Left by a rikolakus master.
Much bigger and nastier than the spawn
Bear terrible diseases
Can send &#34;creatures of the night&#34; into frenzies.
If a Rikolaus drains your blood, it turns you into a spawn



Tracking



Lost track of the trail
Hill
Leafless trees
Trees ~50 feet
Tree doesn&#39;t have leaves ever
Trees: Covered in wheat dolls.
The trees are covered in toxic sap
We found the trail, it leads to a tunnel. It&#39;s pretty near town
We found the trail, it leads to a tunnel. It&#39;s pretty near town
The hole was not dug by claws.
So it was dug by the spades!







Tunnel



Elgamal hears clanging metal up ahead, can&#39;t see.
Tarantula is woozy
Edalyn does some bullshit.
There&#39;s a weird druidic magic afoot.
Allows someone to uncoil their intestine and use as rope
I stumbled while trying to stealth



Perception



Something that is not mud on one wall
Cobblestone poking through
A wall to some basement.
So they&#39;re burrowing inside the town





Tunneling



Further down the tunnel
An incomplete iron column with designs carved onto it.
We fought a Rikolaus master and some generic vampire spawn
We destroyed the tower
