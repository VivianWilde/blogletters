Taking Down Kiordan



Get to Lastwall, find Margaret&#39;s lab
Find Margaret&#39;s wife/QPP/??? with Edalyn&#39;s spirit ritual
Curse shop in Absalom has a curse-breaking department
Truename: Recover Margaret&#39;s memories, peek about in there for the truename





Genevieve



Fill in those holes if we can (in Margaret&#39;s memory)
Investigate the slate. Try to understand it&#39;s mind-affecting powers and undo them
Fix the clean slate, and use it to erase her deadname





Unanswered Questions



What is Drannith&#39;s deal?
Why was the jewel left in the town hall and not taken by the vampires? Were there actually no Kiordan vamps inside the city? Because there was just spawn and the avatar, was this some kind of remote-activated massacre? Or did we get to it before they could?





Others



Communicate with the house: Try a probe
Undo vampirism





DONE
/ Irrelevant



Find Womble and the docs
Mosquito Witch
Investigate Margaret&#39;s memories
Specifically, the shape of the holes left by clean-slate fuckery
Read the cat&#39;s mind
Find Petey&#39;s parents, if they&#39;re alive
