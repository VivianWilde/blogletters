Biography

Traveled the world extensively as a scholar, developed a fascination with mental/psionic magic
Settled down in Absalom as an enigmatic academic
Wound up working with the Grand Archive, trained in being a psychic
Her recent work - some fairly technical but still fascinating research on mental hardening - methods to secure the mind against control and possession

Appearance

Height: 3&#39;6, tall for a gnome but short for everything else
Eyes: Piercing electric blue
Hair: Pixie cut, color changes every day but it&rsquo;s usually something vibrant and noticeable
Hands casting somatic message as a stim
Eyes always staring intently at a target as if boring a hole in them
Very rarely blinks
