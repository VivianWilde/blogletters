* Taking Down Kiordan
- Mosquito Witch
- Find Womble and the docs
* Genevieve
- Investigate Margaret's memories. Specifically, the shape of the holes left by clean-slate fuckery.
- Fill in those holes if we can
- Investigate the slate. Try to understand it's mind-affecting powers and undo them (Genevieve)
- Fix the clean slate, and use it to erase her deadname
* Unanswered Questions
- Why was the jewel left in the town hall and not taken by the vampires? Were there actually no Kiordan vamps inside the city? Because there was just spawn and the avatar, was this some kind of remote-activated massacre? (Vivien)
* Others
- Communicate with the house (Fennec)
- Undo vampirism (Margaret)
