* Arrival
- Fennec gave me a lilac tattoo
- We're heading to Lastwall
- Grace, a town in Ustalov
- Just outside the gravelands
- Lastwall is surrounded by a wall
- inside there are keeps that control gates for accessing gravelands, for the knights reclaimant
- knights reclaimant - taken the crimson oath. Survivors or descendants of survivors. Guard the gravelands hoping to retake Lastwall. 
- also, it's an insanely dangerous job, walls are often under undead siege. To journey into Lastwall is deadly for a reclaimant. 
- oath - semi-divine. Pledged through divine means, often come with divine power. 
- so they're good guy paladins, roughly.
- crimson oath.
- Plan: Fennec will talk to them, try to get access and sneak us in.
