* Picking back up
- We haven't met a true Rikolaus, but we did find footprints. Suggestive
-
** Zura
- Bad stuff that happens if we take the idol: Zura is a demon lord. But she's not able to levy curses on artifacts like Spider can.
- If it's pissing off the witch, she will not like us carrying it.
- Zuni: "The boy is safe"
- We dehallowed the statue
- Zuni climbed onto my shoulder!
- Zuni's claws are ephemeral and shifting
*** Paper Doll
- The writing is leaking some red and sticky substance
- It's not blood.
- It tastes a bit like blood. But too sweet and viscous. Like sap.
*** We're off to see the +Wizard+ Witch
- Petey followed Zuni into a swamp
- As the mosquito and Petey descend towards the swamp, they blip and vanish
- There's a teleport field or illusory wall up
**** Tunnel
- Sounds like a battlefield in the distance
- Opens into a large chamber
- People lying on straw mats, unconscious
- Medbay?
- Perplexed-looking Petey.
- Two adults, two children
- Children look like Petey
- A 9ft tall hunched figure has bright red eyes
* Mosquito Witch
- We have a bargain:
- We fell the tower
- She will return Petey, and help us against Zura.
- She's like a mentor/grandparent to Petey
* Cultist's House Again
- Tracks: Left by a rikolakus master.
- Much bigger and nastier than the spawn
- Bear terrible diseases
- Can send "creatures of the night" into frenzies.
- If a Rikolaus drains your blood, it turns you into a spawn
** Tracking
- Lost track of the trail
- Hill
- Leafless trees
- Trees ~50 feet
- Tree doesn't have leaves ever
- Trees: Covered in wheat dolls.
- The trees are covered in toxic sap
- We found the trail, it leads to a tunnel. It's pretty near town
- We found the trail, it leads to a tunnel. It's pretty near town
- The hole was not dug by claws.
- So it was dug by the spades!
* Tunnel
- Elgamal hears clanging metal up ahead, can't see.
- Tarantula is woozy
- Edalyn does some bullshit.
- There's a weird druidic magic afoot.
- Allows someone to uncoil their intestine and use as rope
- I stumbled while trying to stealth
**** Perception
- Something that is not mud on one wall
- Cobblestone poking through
- A wall to some basement.
- So they're burrowing inside the town
*** Tunneling
- Further down the tunnel
- An incomplete iron column with designs carved onto it.
- We fought a Rikolaus master and some generic vampire spawn
- We destroyed the tower
