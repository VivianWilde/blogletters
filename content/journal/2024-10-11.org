- Alonzo (Church), my colleague
- Conjecture: Most "memory-erasure" is just burying.
- Turns out I'm right.
- Unburying memories: Depends on the source
- Some deities can truly wipe memories
- BUT! That's not what happened to Margaret!
- Buried in her, or perhaps in an external source.
- There's often a link between a subject and the source/storehouse of the memories
- Conjecture: Does the clean slate store the original unaltered memories, or reference/fragments somehow?
- Evaluation: This may be possible. But the clean slate also creates new memories and _manipulates_ old ones rather than erasing them. So it might be maintaining the "web of real and unreal", or storing old memories, or some combination thereof.
- The clean slate combines fabrication with truth. So if it holds any info, it might be a mix of real and fabricated.
- Implication: Margaret got memories erased in non-clean-slate ways, since erased rather than rewritten
- Identifying storehouses: Difficult generally. Magical signature analysis.
- Can I try to read the mind of the Slate?
- This is pretty hard undo.
- Seek out original owners - presumably spider-priests in the expanse, or in Absalom.
- Slate is also a repository of memories of some kind.
- Can I interface with the slate? A: Maybe
- Finding memories without storehouse: Doable (I did it). Some memories slip through the cracks, they can be uncovered with a good link that sparks the memories. But stuff in the repository is locked in.
- If you aren't a god: Deletion is an option (although that didn't happen with Margaret, we think), reconstruction (overwriting).
- That's not what Margaret has, she lost her memories
- "Supposedly the clean slate retains all the originals"
- He's doing undead tissue research. Introduce him to Margaret?
